## Description

This group project is a roguelike game. Players play as our hero, a rat, trying to get through a enemy-filled hotel in order to reach the Chosen Cheese!
The challenge of the project was to use a grid-based system for the game, which was implemented into the floor generation and obstacle mapping. The game was also practice of Java programming and object oriented programming.
